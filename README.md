Before running the script, create an environment. It can be created by calling env\create_environment.bat (for Windows) or env/create_environment.sh (for Mac or Linux). After the environment is created, you can launch the Jupyter notebook and use the CTR.py script. If the environment is already created, you can start it by calling env\start.bat or env/start.sh.
